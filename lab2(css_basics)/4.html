<!-- Design a responsive webpage layout using CSS Flexbox. Create a container with multiple items and apply flexbox properties such as flex-direction, justify-content, align-items and flex-wrap. Demonstrate the use of flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis on flex items. Use flexbox to design a navigation bar and a card-style layout that adjusts properly on different screen sizes. -->

<!-- flex-direction → Decides the direction of flex items (row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse).
justify-content → Controls horizontal alignment and spacing of items inside the container.
align-items → Controls vertical alignment of items inside the container.
flex-wrap → Decides whether items stay in one line or move to the next line when space is small.
flex-grow → Defines how much an item can grow compared to other items when extra space is available.
flex-shrink → Defines how much an item can shrink compared to other items when space is limited.
flex-basis → Sets the initial size of a flex item before growing or shrinking happens. -->
