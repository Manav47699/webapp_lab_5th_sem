<!-- Create a webpage that demonstrates CSS positioning and display properties. Use different elements and apply static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning. Apply display values such as block, inline, inline-block, and none. Use z-index to show overlapping elements and apply overflow properties such as hidden, scroll and auto where necessary. -->


<!--
- position: static → Default position; element stays in normal document flow.
- position: relative → Moves relative to its original position without leaving normal flow.
- position: absolute → Removes element from normal flow and positions it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
- position: fixed → Positions element relative to the viewport; stays fixed when scrolling.
- position: sticky → Acts normal until a scroll point, then sticks like fixed.


- display: block → Takes full width and starts on a new line.
- display: inline → Stays in line and only takes necessary width.
- display: inline-block → Stays inline but allows width and height to be set.
- display: none → Completely removes element from layout and screen.


- z-index → Controls which positioned element appears on top.

- overflow: hidden → Hides content that goes outside the box.
- overflow: scroll → Always shows scrollbars.
- overflow: auto → Shows scrollbars only when needed.
