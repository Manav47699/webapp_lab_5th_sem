<!-- Create a webpage using HTML and CSS that displays student information in a tabular format. Use the <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> tags to design the table with appropriate headings and at least seven rows of student data. Apply CSS to style the table including borders, padding, spacing, text alignment, background colors and font styling. Use alternate row coloring, hover effects, and table caption styling to improve readability and visual appeal. Ensure that the table is responsive and maintains proper structure and alignment on different screen sizes. -->
