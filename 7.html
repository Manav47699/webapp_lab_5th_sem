    <h1>Create a webpage using HTML only that demonstrates the use of
different types of lists. Display an unordered list showing at least
five favorite subjects or skills and an ordered list showing three
daily activities or steps of a process. Also include a description list
(&lt;dl&gt;) with at least two terms and their corresponding descriptions.
Demonstrate list nesting by placing one list inside another and as a
mini challenge, change the list style using the type attribute and
create a mixed list where an unordered list is placed inside an
ordered list.</h1>
