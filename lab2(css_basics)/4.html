<!-- Design a responsive webpage layout using CSS Flexbox. Create a container with multiple items and apply flexbox properties such as flex-direction, justify-content, align-items and flex-wrap. Demonstrate the use of flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis on flex items. Use flexbox to design a navigation bar and a card-style layout that adjusts properly on different screen sizes. -->
