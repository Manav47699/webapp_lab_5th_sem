<!-- Create a webpage that demonstrates the CSS Box Model. Design multiple <div> elements and apply margin, padding, border, width, and height properties to each element. Use different border styles and border radius values. Show the difference between box-sizing: content-box and box-sizing: border-box by applying them to different elements. Ensure proper spacing between elements so that the effect of each box model property is clearly visible -->

<!--

- CSS box model: it is set using "box-sizing:" attribute. A html element is considered a box divided into Content, Padding, Border & Margin.

- content-box(default): Here the height and width that we set are only applied to the Content part.

- border-box: Here width and height include padding and border.
